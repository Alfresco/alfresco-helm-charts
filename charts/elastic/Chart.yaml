  WARNING: This chart is meant to ease initial deployment for TESTING purposes.
  DO NOT use this chart in any staging, or production environment. It has very
  limited options. It is not meant to be configurable and we do not aim at
  making it particularly secure or add features to it. Its SOLE goal is to allow
  for quickly spinning up an Alfresco platform on kubernetes, any issue that
  does not affect this is likely to not be fixed. For any other purpose, make
  sure to deploy your own enterprise grade Elasticsearch instance and configure
  Alfresco charts to point to it.
