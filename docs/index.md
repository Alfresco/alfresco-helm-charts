# Alfresco Helm Charts

This website contains user documentation for the independent and lightweight
[Helm](https://helm.sh) charts for Alfresco Content Services platform that can
be used as building blocks by devops teams to build the Content Services
platform that match the organization needs.

Check the [acs-deployment](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/)
repository for an example of how to leverage these charts on an umbrella chart.

If you want to understand what are the principles to leverage in order to build
on top of Alfresco components' chart please refer to the
[Build your own charts](build-your-own-charts.md) section.

Each individual chart has its own autogenerated reference documentation in
[charts](reference.md). Default values are documented there.

There is also a section for [guides](guides/index.md) describing how to cover specific use cases.
